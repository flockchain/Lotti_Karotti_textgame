# Lotti_Karotti_textgame
Here I have implemented the Lotti-Karotti game according to the original concept as a text-based console game. For 2 - 4 players. Have fun
This text game is in the german language!

To play this game:

- Open any working environment for c++ projects
- Create a new project
- clone this repository into an seperate folder
- include header and source files 
- start it and have fun!
